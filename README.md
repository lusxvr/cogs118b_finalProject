# cogs118b_finalProject

This is the Final Project in the Class COGS118B - Intro to Machine Learning at UCSD of Sam, Luis and Paul.

We classified the MNIST Skin Cancer Data Set using different approaches.

We used both K-Means and a Neural Network to classify the images based on their raw data.

Additionally we used PCA to extract the Principal Components from the Images and reconstructed them with the 10% most important Principal Components.

Both K-Means and the Neural Network then were trained and evaluated on the original and the pca-reduced data.
